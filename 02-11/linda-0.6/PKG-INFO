Description: 
        Linda is an widely studied distributed computing environment, centred around
        the notion of a tuple space. A tuple space is a bag (also called a multi-set) of
        tuples. A tuple is an ordered, typed chunk of data. Tuple spaces exist
        independently of processes in the system, and the data placed into a tuple space
        also exist independently. See "Generative communication in Linda" (1985) and
        "Multiple tuple spaces in Linda" both by David Gelernter for more information on
        Linda.
        
        PyLinda is a simple implementation of a linda system, however it also includes
        several of the more recently proposed extensions to Linda in the form of multiple
        tuple spaces, garbage collection, sane non-blocking primitives and bulk tuple
        operations.
